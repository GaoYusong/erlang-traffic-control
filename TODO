1. tune the process of the calc total_tokens, when maxcps cannot be divided 
   add_tokens_interval exactly.

{maybe NP-Hard...}
2. add a manager to auto manage new/delete tokens_queue, this will less the lack 
   of processes compared with user manage tokens_queue himself.

3. add an adjust when maxcps less than add_tokens_total, for when 
   maxcps < add_tokens_total, some total_tokens will be zero, this should be 
   processed, but now the real maxcps will be add_tokens_total.

4. add auto test framework for TestCase

5. add more methods to request_tokens, the sleep don't adapt to all cases.
