1. tune the process of the calc total_tokens, when maxcps cannot be divided 
   add_tokens_interval exactly.
{complete!} 

2. add a manager to auto manage new/delete tokens_queue, this will less the lack 
   of processes compared with user manage tokens_queue himself.
{maybe NP-Hard...}
   
3. add an adjust when maxcps less than add_tokens_total, for when 
   maxcps < add_tokens_total, some total_tokens will be zero, this should be 
   processed, but now the real maxcps will be add_tokens_total.
{complete!}

4. add auto test framework for TestCase

5. add more methods to request_tokens, the sleep don't adapt to all cases.

	description

	can set a callback function, and call request_tokens_cast and receive a message to continue. 
	request_tokens_cast is async, it will return immediately no matter whether a tokens is avaiable,
	but when a tokens is avaiable it will call your callback function, you can use your callback 
	function wake up your process.
