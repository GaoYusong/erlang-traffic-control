{complete!} 1. tune the process of the calc total_tokens, when maxcps cannot be divided add_tokens_interval exactly.
2. add a manager to auto manage new/delete tokens_queue, this will less the lack of processes compared with user manage tokens_queue himself.
3. add an adjust when maxcps less than add_tokens_total, for when maxcps < add_tokens_total, some total_tokens will be zero, this should be processed, but now the real maxcps will be add_tokens_total.
